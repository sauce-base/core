# Security Audit Report - Sauce Base Core

**Date:** 2024
**Auditor:** GitHub Copilot Security Audit
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit was performed on the Sauce Base Core application, a modern Laravel SaaS starter kit. The audit identified several areas for improvement and implemented comprehensive security enhancements.

### Key Findings

✅ **No Critical Vulnerabilities Found**
- npm audit: 0 vulnerabilities in production dependencies
- No XSS vulnerabilities detected
- No SQL injection risks (using Eloquent ORM)
- No secrets committed to repository
- Proper .gitignore configuration

⚠️ **Security Improvements Implemented**
- Fixed overly permissive CORS configuration
- Added comprehensive security headers
- Enabled session encryption
- Created extensive security documentation

## Detailed Findings

### 1. CORS Configuration (Medium Priority) - FIXED ✅

**Issue:** The CORS configuration allowed all origins (`*`) with credentials disabled.

**Risk:** Could allow unauthorized cross-origin requests from any domain.

**Fix Implemented:**
```php
// Before
'allowed_origins' => ['*'],
'supports_credentials' => false,

// After
'allowed_origins' => explode(',', env('CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS', 'http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173')),
'supports_credentials' => true,
```

**Files Modified:**
- `config/cors.php`
- `.env.example`
- `.env.production.example`

### 2. Missing Security Headers (Medium Priority) - FIXED ✅

**Issue:** No security headers middleware to protect against common attacks.

**Risk:** Vulnerable to clickjacking, XSS, MIME sniffing, and other browser-based attacks.

**Fix Implemented:**
- Created `SecurityHeaders` middleware
- Automatically applies security headers in production
- Configurable via environment variables

**Headers Added:**
- Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Permissions-Policy
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) - production only

**Files Created:**
- `app/Http/Middleware/SecurityHeaders.php`

**Files Modified:**
- `bootstrap/app.php`

### 3. Session Encryption (Low Priority) - FIXED ✅

**Issue:** Session encryption was disabled in `.env.example`.

**Risk:** Session data stored in plain text, potential information disclosure.

**Fix Implemented:**
```bash
# Before
SESSION_ENCRYPT=false

# After
SESSION_ENCRYPT=true
SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true  # Added
SESSION_HTTP_ONLY=true      # Added
SESSION_SAME_SITE=lax       # Added
```

**Files Modified:**
- `.env.example`
- `.env.production.example`

### 4. Missing Security Documentation (Low Priority) - FIXED ✅

**Issue:** No comprehensive security documentation or deployment guidelines.

**Risk:** Developers might not follow security best practices during development and deployment.

**Fix Implemented:**
Created comprehensive security documentation:

1. **SECURITY.md** (6,349 bytes)
   - Security policy and vulnerability reporting
   - Best practices for all security domains
   - Production deployment checklist
   - Common vulnerability prevention

2. **docs/DEPLOYMENT_SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md** (7,563 bytes)
   - 100+ checklist items for production deployment
   - Server configuration guidelines
   - Security verification steps
   - Regular maintenance schedule

3. **docs/SECURITY_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** (6,493 bytes)
   - Quick reference for common security tasks
   - Environment variable configurations
   - Emergency response procedures
   - Security command reference

4. **README.md** - Added security section
   - Links to all security documentation
   - Security vulnerability reporting contact
